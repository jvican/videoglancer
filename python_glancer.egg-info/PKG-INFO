# Python Glancer

This folder contains a Python reimplementation of the original `glancer` tool.
It exposes the same command line interface:

```
glancer URL FILEPATH
```

- `URL`: YouTube URL to fetch.
- `FILEPATH`: Base name for the generated HTML (omit the `.html` extension).

The Python port requires the following executables on your `$PATH`:

- `yt-dlp`
- `ffmpeg`

Both commands are used exactly like in the Haskell version: `yt-dlp` downloads
the video and English subtitles, while `ffmpeg` extracts frames every 30 seconds.

## Development

From this directory you can run the tool with:

```
python -m glancer_py.cli <URL> <FILEPATH>
```

Once installed via `pip install .`, you can use the `glancer` entry point.

The generated HTML mirrors the original layout. Each slide combines an embedded
base64 JPEG frame with the captions that overlap that 30-second window, and
links let you jump back to the corresponding point in YouTube.
